This is basically [vbextreme's repo](https://github.com/vbextreme/Scheduler), just with a [tiny typo fix](https://github.com/Letsric/Arduino-Scheduler/commit/f187566fc40e3aa9ac4a79d92147dfeacf69b301) merged from [upstram](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Scheduler). With this, it's functionally up to date with upstream, as they didn't change the actual `src`-Directory since the mentioned commit. (see [here](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Scheduler/commits/master/src))

I just made this to use it until the [official PR](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Scheduler/pull/1) gets merged.

# Scheduler Library for Arduino

The Scheduler library enables the Arduino to run multiple functions at the same time. This allows tasks to happen without interrupting each other.
